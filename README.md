# prework-study-guide
Here we go! First repo- Creation of a study guide

# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This webpage is a high level summary of what I learned while navigating the Prework assignments for the coding bootcamp put on by University of Washington. I created this guide to collect new things I learned that I'd want to refer back to, as well as use it as a space to experiment. 

Throughout the process, I learned some elementary things about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.


## Installation

n/a

## Usage

This guide can be used throughout the couse to reference and add to as I learn more information. 

In the future if I'd like to include a screenshot I will create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

n/a...but shout out to my tutor who helped me get out of a jam!

## License
